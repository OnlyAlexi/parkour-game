Tiny fun project I had! The main thing I wanted to do was program some movement options for a different game I was working on.
The main thing I took away from this was the slope-sliding mechanic.

Chose not to include the code for the hook-shot as it was buggy and unfinished, I want to completely re-do it using constraints.
